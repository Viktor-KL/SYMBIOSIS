					<p class="subtitle about__subtitle">
						Symbiosis is a world where resources are scarce. Technology is integrated into society like never before. Due to this, society has been divided into two distinctive groups of people. These include those that support the policies of the corporations and those that oppose them. <br><br>
						Corporations have the main priority in global modification when it comes to human bodies; this means that they can enhance the human body's capabilities but at the cost of people using a bit more of their humanity. As such, not everyone agrees with this future. <br><br>
						As such, a group known as the “Pure” aims to sabotage the work of the Corporation. “Votum” supporters improve their bodies to infinity with implants, while the Pure strive to restore naturally clean bodies. <br><br>
						Which side will you be on, the <b>“Pure"</b> or the <b>"Votum”</b> coalition of corporations?

                <p class="faq__subtitle">Symbiosis is a representation of an alternative technological future of our world. There are two opposing views on society that are colliding. <br><br>
				There is a consistent push toward consumerism and new technological advancements, where some people are striving toward changing themselves beyond recognition. <br><br>
				However, not everyone strives to push in this direction, and there is an alternative, fanatical rejection of alterations of the human body. <br><br>
				The stories, activities, and NFT collections will be your entry into this world, where the Pure and the Votum are battling for the future they believe in.

                <p class="faq__subtitle">LOLA is short for "Lots of Lands." Through the utilization of NFT-based real-time strategy, players are given the opportunity to build on top of blockchain technology, and they can immerse themselves in the world of an anarchic, cyberpunk reality, where they can build an empire, unite other players, quarrel with one another and engage in conflicts, whilst also building a virtual economy with the eventual goal of reaching world dominance. </p>

				Owners of these NFTs will be given the opportunity to cross-breed them, after the public mint, as a means of creating NFTs of a higher level and power. <br><br>
				There will be 1,000 tokens for the public minting phase and another 100 for the WL.</p>
